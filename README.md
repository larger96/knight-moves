# Knight Moves

A project created for The Odin Project.

[Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms) to the original assignment page.

## Objective
To build a function #knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

## What I've Learned
* Applications of how to use BFS.
* Greater understanding of data structures.

## Visual Output
```ruby
knight_moves([3, 3], [4, 3])
=> You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
   [3, 3]
   [5, 4]
   [3, 5]
   [4, 3]
```
